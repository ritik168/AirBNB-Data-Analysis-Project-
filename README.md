## 🔴 Business Problem and Answer


1️⃣ What factors affect Airbnb listing prices?

Prices are mainly influenced by location, room type, number of reviews, availability, and minimum nights. Entire homes in prime locations are priced higher than shared or private rooms.


2️⃣ Which locations have the highest demand?

Listings in city centers and popular tourist areas show higher booking demand and review counts compared to outskirts.


3️⃣ Which room type performs best?

Entire home/apartment listings generate higher revenue, while private rooms attract budget travelers and higher occupancy.


4️⃣ How does availability impact bookings?

Listings with moderate availability perform better than those always available or rarely available, indicating balanced demand.


5️⃣ Do reviews influence pricing and bookings?

Listings with more reviews and higher ratings can charge higher prices and still maintain strong demand.


6️⃣ Which hosts perform better?

Experienced hosts with multiple listings show better pricing optimization and higher occupancy.
